# Color Palette Generator

This is a simple color palette generator app built with React. It allows you to generate a palette of 18 random colors, and then copy the hex code of any color to your clipboard. You can also toggle between a light and dark mode.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-palette-generator.git
cd color-palette-generator
npm install
```

Then, start the development server:

```
npm start
```

The app will be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Code Overview

The app consists of two main components: the `App` component and the `ColorPalette` component.

The `App` component is the main component of the app. It renders the `ColorPalette` component and handles the state of the app, such as the current color palette and the light/dark mode.

The `ColorPalette` component renders the color palette. It uses the `randomColor` function to generate a palette of 18 random colors. It then renders each color as a `<div>` element with the color's hex code displayed inside.

## Using the App

To use the app, simply click the "Generate colors" button. This will generate a new palette of 18 random colors. You can then click on any color to copy its hex code to your clipboard.

You can also toggle between a light and dark mode by clicking the "Toggle mode" button.

## Conclusion

This is a simple color palette generator app built with React. It is a great way to learn how to use React and how to create a simple user interface.
